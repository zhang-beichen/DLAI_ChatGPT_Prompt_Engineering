# DeepLearning.AI: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

May 2023

Jupyter Notebooks from the course [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) on the DeepLearning.AI. These notebooks are used as demos for the lectures with the provided API key. They cannot be downloaded, so I organized them here for ease of reproducing. **However, to run these scripts locally, you will need to have your own valid API key at the OpenAI.**
